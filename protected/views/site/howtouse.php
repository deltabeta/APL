            <h3>Search</h3>
    <p>
The search function gives you the option to search by country, field of interest, language, region, position of journalists and mediatypes.<br>
<br>
After you click the search button you will be presented with the results of your search.<br>
<br>
The contacts in the search results are grouped under their respective companies or job types, this makes it easier to select, de-select, or later on edit groups of contacts.</p>
<p>
Now you have found your contacts, it's time to organise them and group them into contact lists in the next step.<br>

            <h3>Create contact list(s)</h3>
    <p>
Contact lists help you to organise contacts by grouping them together. Making a specific contact list for your mailing, helps you in better targeting your audience.<br>
<br>
Creating contact lists is organising mail addresses for your convenience, it will not cost you credits and the system will not send them out unless you use these contact lists in a press release.<br>
<br>
<em>Example: You want to send out a mailing to all people working in sports who speak or publish in french.</em><br>
<br>
First you complete the search with those specific filters.<br>
category : Sports | language : French and leave the other filters as they are.</p>
    
    <p>
When the search results show up you can select the people you would like to include in your list and then add them to a new contact list named “Sports people French” or something similar.<br>
<br>
The newly created contact list can be found by clicking on the my contact list button above the search options. You can later edit this contact list by adding or deleting people.<br>
<br>
Let's examine the tools for creating a contact list.&nbsp;This screen shows the search result after a search, besides the search results a new toolbar shows up, this is where you create the contactlist(s).<br>
<br>
To free up some screen space, and make more room for the search results and contactlist creation you can hide the search options if you like.<br>
<br>
Now for the rest of the tools.&nbsp;This screen shows the various ways of selecting and filtering the search results.<br>
<br>
The checkboxes to the left of the category and names let you select an entire category of people or select individual contacts.</p>

            <p>
The "My Press Release" page gives you an overview of all your press releases, they are seperated into several statuses.<br>
<strong><br>
<u>New</u></strong><br>
Create a new press release<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Scheduled</u></strong><br>
All press releases waiting in queue that will be sent out on a specific date.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Draft</u></strong><br>
All press releases that are not scheduled, waiting for further adjustments.&nbsp;You can edit a draft release by clicking on its name, you can then make edits and save it as a draft again, or change the publication type and send out the press release.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Sent releases</u></strong><br>
Sent releases shows you a list of all sent releases with a status.<br>
<strong><u><br>
Status completed</u></strong><br>
The press release was sent out successfully, you can see the statistics of this release by clicking on the name.&nbsp;The newly opened page will show you when it was sent out, how many contacts where mailed and shows you a map of Africa with views per country.&nbsp;Here you can also download the press release as en .eml file.<br>
<strong><u><br>
Status failed</u></strong><br>
Something obviously went wrong sending this press release.&nbsp;Click on the name of the press release that failed to see more details about the error.&nbsp;Some errors are self explanatory for example:</p>
 <ul>
<li>
failed (global_error: Zero contacts were mailed.)</li>
</ul>
            
 <p>
This one can simply be solved by editing this release, including a contactlist with your press release, and then re-sending it.<br>
